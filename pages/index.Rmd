## üëãüèª What is this workshop about? 
The course will give an overview on how to **tackle the analysis of spatial molecular data**. During the workshop we will dive into a **spatial transcriptomics experiment** and carry out the main steps of a standard data analysis pipeline.

# Program Outline

## Introduction 
- Setup RStudio
- Get familiar with the interface
- Download relevant packages and set up the computing environment
- Get an introduction to the type of data we are going to use

## Overview of the data and QC
- Learn about data normalization and filtering
- Explore different normalization methods
- Normalize and explore the data with functions provided by the `Seurat` and `Giotto` packages
- Clustering
- Cell type profile decomposition and spot enrichment

## Downstream analyses leveraging spatial information
- Identification of spatially-coordinated genes
- Identification of spatially-aware spot domains
- Ligand-receptor inference analysis with `LIANA`

# Credits
Some of the images and inspiration came from other tutorials available online, in particular [this work](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/spatial_vignette.html) for the Seurat steps and [this work](https://drieslab.github.io/giotto_workshop_2024/introduction-to-the-giotto-package.html) for some of the information regarding the status of spatial data analysis and Giotto functions. Additionally, the overall low of the workshop was inspired by this work presented at an [earlier EMBO workshop](https://meetings.embo.org/event/24-cancer-bio). All of the code present within this site was developed and is readily implementable in [RStudio](https://posit.co/) using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)>4.4.0.
